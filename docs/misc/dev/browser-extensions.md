# Browser extensions
AliasVault offers browser extensions compatible with both Chrome and Firefox. This guide explains how to build and debug the extensions locally.

## Development Setup
The browser extensions are built using:
- React: https://react.dev/
- WXT: https://wxt.dev/ (A framework for cross-browser extension development)
- Vite: https://vitejs.dev/

### Install dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your host machine, then install the dependencies:

```bash
cd apps/browser-extension
npm install
```

### Development Mode
WXT provides a development mode that automatically reloads changes and opens a new browser window with the extension loaded:

```bash
# For Google Chrome development
npm run dev:chrome

# For Firefox development
npm run dev:firefox

# For Microsoft Edge development
npm run dev:edge
```

## Building and Loading the Extensions Manually

### Google Chrome

1. Build the extension:
```bash
npm run build:chrome
```

2. Load in Chrome:
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner
   - Click "Load unpacked" and the folder `./apps/browser-extension/dist/chrome-mv3`

### Firefox

1. Build the extension:
```bash
npm run build:firefox
```

2. Load in Firefox:
   - Open Firefox and navigate to `about:debugging`
   - Click "This Firefox" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
   - Navigate to the `./apps/browser-extension/dist/firefox-mv2` folder and select the `manifest.json` file

### Microsoft Edge

1. Build the extension:
```bash
npm run build:edge
```

2. Load in Edge:
   - Open Edge and navigate to `edge://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner
   - Click "Load unpacked" and the folder `./apps/browser-extension/dist/edge-mv3`

### Safari

1. Build the extension:
```bash
npm run build:safari
```

2. Open the Xcode project in the `safari-xcode/AliasVault/AliasVault.xcodeproj` folder and build / run the app.

3. The extension will be installed automatically in Safari. Follow the on-screen MacOS app instructions to complete the installation.

## Automatic tests
The extension has a suite of automatic tests that are run on every pull request. These tests are located in the `__tests__` directories scattered throughout the browser extension codebase.

### Run the tests
To run the tests locally, you can use the `npm run test` command. This will run all tests.

```bash
npm run test
```

## Manual tests
In order to test for client side issues, here is a list of public websites that have caused issues in the past and can be used to test whether the extension is (still) working correctly.

### Websites that have caused issues
