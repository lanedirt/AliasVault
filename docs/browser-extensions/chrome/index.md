2. Click on the "Add to Chrome" button
3. The extension will be installed and added to your browser

## Build from Source
If you wish to install the extension from source instead, see the [build-from-source](build-from-source.md) documentation. This will allow you to make changes to the extension and/or to use a specific version of the extension.
