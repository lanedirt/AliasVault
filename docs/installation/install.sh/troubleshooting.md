## Check Docker Container Status
For any issues you might encounter, the first step is to check the Docker containers health. This will give you a quick insight into the status of the individual containers which will help you identify the root cause of the issue.

1. List all running containers and their status (execute from the AliasVault installation directory):
```bash
docker compose ps
```

2. Check the logs of a specific container.
```
docker compose logs [container-name-here]]
```
> Possible container names: `api`, `postgres`, `client`, `admin`, `reverse-proxy`, `smtp`, `task-runner`

3. In order to restart a specific container, run the following command:
```bash
docker compose restart [container-name-here]
```

4. In order to restart the whole AliasVault stack, do not use docker compose directly, but run the following command instead. This makes sure the correct `docker-compose.yml` file is being used:
```bash
./install.sh restart
```

## Check AliasVault Text Logs
All AliasVault services log information and errors to text files. These files are located in the `logs` directory. You can check the logs of a specific container by running the following command:

```bash
cat logs/[container-name-here].log
```

## Common Issues
Below are some common issues you might encounter and how to troubleshoot them.

### 1. Database Connection Issues

**Symptoms:**
- API, Admin, or SMTP services failing to start
- Database connection errors in logs

**Steps:**
1. Check if PostgreSQL container is running:
```bash
docker compose ps
```

2. Check the logs of the PostgreSQL container:
```bash
docker compose logs postgres
```

### 2. SSL Certificate Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Browser shows SSL errors

**Steps:**
1. Check the certbot container logs if SSL certificates are being correctly renewed:
```bash
docker compose logs certbot
```

2. Check the logs of the reverse-proxy container:
```bash
docker compose logs reverse-proxy
```

3. In case the SSL certificates are being correctly renewed, but the browser still shows SSL errors, try to restart AliasVault manually in order to force the NGINX container to reload the SSL certificates:
```bash
./install.sh restart
```

### 3. No emails being received
If you are not receiving emails on your aliases, check the following:
- Verify DNS records are correctly configured
- Ensure ports 25 and 587 are accessible
- Check your server's firewall settings
- Verify that your ISP/hosting provider allows SMTP traffic

Refer to the [installation guide](./install.md) for more information on how to configure your DNS records and ports.


### 4. Forgot AliasVault Admin Password
If you have lost your admin password, you can reset it by running the install script with the `reset-admin-password` option. This will generate a new random password and update the .env file with it. After that it will restart the AliasVault containers to apply the changes.

```bash
./install.sh reset-admin-password
```
