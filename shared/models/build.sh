This folder contains the output of the shared \`$package_name\` module from the \`/shared\` directory in the AliasVault project.

**Do not edit any of these files manually.**

To make changes:
1. Update the source files in the \`/shared/models/src\` directory
2. Run the \`build.sh\` script in the module directory to regenerate the outputs and copy them here.
